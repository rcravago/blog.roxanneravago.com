  <p>Preface: This story comes from a period this year when I spent three months in Costa Rica, participating in a retreat for computer programmers called, Hacker Paradise. </p>
<p>--</p>
<p>We&#39;d gone out the night before and came back at 4:30 in the morning. Suffice to say we had a good night. </p>
<p>Still hungover, all I could think of was the constant pounding from the left temple of my forehead as I sat there slouched on the couch listening to one of the hackers, Luka, explain the agenda.</p>
<p>Damn, why did he have to hold this workshop today -- I thought to myself. </p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Yesterday, Luka had asked each person individually, including me, if we would like to participate in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">&#39;Game of Life&#39;</a> workshop that he was organizing. It was endearing. I mean, who takes the time to sit down with 20+ people individually, explain the workshop, try to get you excited, and then personally ask if you would like to join? not many. how could you say...no?</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>That day arrived. When Luka finished explaining the workshop in detail and the time came for us to pair ourselves up with someone to work with on the first round, I came up with my best excuse to opt out--the &quot;I don&#39;t feel well, my head aches, and I&#39;m still too hungover to function&quot; excuse. </p>
<p>Excuses, excuses. no excuses. just do it -- Bryan, one of the hackers, called me out. </p>
<p>The truth is, Bryan was right. I began to talk myself out of doing it before even trying. Sure, I was hungover and my head ached but deep down, I created these excuses for myself out of fear. </p>
<p>Imagine that kid sitting on the bench, last to get picked to play on their team, not by choice but because there was no one else better to choose from? Or how about that kid who asks the most beautiful girl to prom, only for her to say no in front of the whole class? Like that little kid, I feared the thought of rejection and disappointment--of someone saying, &quot;no, I don&#39;t want to work with you&quot; because I wasn&#39;t good enough compared to the other hackers that had years of experience in programming. </p>
<p>But I did it anyways. I asked Danny, a fellow hacker sitting next to me if he&#39;d like to work with me on the first round. And it wasn&#39;t bad. It wasn&#39;t bad at all. Danny said yes, and we worked together to re-create the &#39;Game of Life&#39; in Objective-C, a programming language I didn&#39;t know. And then I asked Scott and he said yes too, so we worked together to re-create the &#39;Game of Life&#39; a second time around in JavaScript, a programming language I was only starting to become proficient in. </p>
<p>Even though I didn&#39;t command these programming languages that we worked in, I helped to problem-solve the logic that would lead us to fully re-create and even enhance the game&#39;s experience. Not only was the workshop both challenging and fun but more importantly, it gave me the opportunity to prove myself wrong and empower me to believe in myself and what I was capable of offering.</p>
<p>Luka said, the whole point of this workshop was to practice working on different aspects of programming with different people, not to complete the task as efficiently as possible but to work on aspects of programming that you donâ€™t often make the time to focus on because it is pushed down behind the list of &#39;other&#39; priorities--demands from your client, customer, boss, whatever. Then you share your experience with others and get feedback, so you can learn from each other.</p>
<p>I like to think of this &#39;Game of Life&#39; workshop as an analogy to a familiar game in which we play everyday--our own lives. Life isn&#39;t about competing against others. It&#39;s about competing with ourselves. Life isn&#39;t about finishing first every time, or even finishing at all. If life was about finishing first every time, we would all follow the same manual handed to us on &quot;how to succeed in life&quot;. Instead, it&#39;s about daring to do something different, even if it means you don&#39;t finish at all. It&#39;s about being confronted with challenges one after another, and throwing out the manual to write your own.</p>
<p>This year, I confronted my biggest fear--
fear that it was actually possible to do the impossible:</p>
<ul>
<li>I taught myself to code. and taught others too.</li>
<li>I quit the 9 - 5.</li>
<li>I got paid for the first time to do something that I could honestly say I love to do--design.</li>
<li>I lived on a suitcase for four months. first in Costa Rica with other hackers, learning from each other, not only about programming but also a lot about life. Then spending time with the most important people in my life, my family in the Philippines. These travels granted me with the gift of experiencing &quot;...everyday things as if for the first time, to be in a position in which almost nothing is so familiar it is taken for granted.&quot;</li>
<li>I reached the best shape of my life, feeling strong on the inside and out.</li>
<li>I met someone I admire, someone who makes me feel free, and that same someone who continually inspires me to be, me. </li>
<li>I read a lot of books, some that changed my life, and filled the pages of countless journals, some that led me to profound insights.</li>
<li>I connected with myself spiritually.</li>
<li>I reclaimed ownership of my energy and time, fully accountable to no one but myself.</li>
<li>I built this from scratch, so I could share my personal experience connecting the dots to continuously re-invent myself and re-design my life.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m not saying I succeeded in all of my earnest intentions to change the different parts of my life. I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;ve completely stopped comparing myself to others. Everyday is a hard-fought battle. but everyday that I take another step forward, I believe in myself more. I believe in my ability to defeat my greatest critic--myself. and I believe in all of you too.</p>
<p>I wish you all a happy new year and to see everyday as an opportunity to take another step forward until one day, you&#39;ve made it to the peak of your mountain. take it all in and enjoy the view.</p>
