it’s waking up to the rooster’s crow, rays of sunlight peeking in past your curtains, filling a once dark room.

it’s the first cup of coffee at 7am.

it’s the pouring rain that brings in a light breeze that kisses your cheeks.

it’s having 300 mosquito bites, all on your ankle down.

it’s getting caught in the rain.
it’s not getting caught in the rain.

it’s conversations where you leave the table and think to yourself, 
“What did we even start talking about?”

it’s falling asleep on the hammock without intending to.

<!-- or..scoop out the rich meat inside -->
<!-- or..break into 2 sentences -->
it’s sipping on a coconut on the beach, then breaking it in half and slitting a side of the shell to use as a makeshift spoon so you can scoop out the rich meat that this fruit bears.

it’s the cold shower after a hard afternoon workout.

<!-- active voice in high tide has passed -->
it’s that moment at sunset when you’re sitting on your surfboard far from the shore. the high tide has passed, and you’re surrounded by the calm waters and the sun that greets you to a beautiful end of day.

it’s the reflection of a blue and purple haze at sunset melting into the ocean, glimmering like there is no separation of heaven and earth.

it’s the nights after dinner when more than four seats crowd the table huddling over a shared dessert and maybe a glass or two of wine. The dim light creating silhouettes on their faces as they chuckle 
and tell stories with each other.

it's 20 hackers under one roof.

it's enjoying this moment to the fullest.

it's <span style="font-weight:400;">pura vida mae.</span></b>
