</div>

<div class="content">
  <p>At the start of the New Year, I challenged myself to a 30-day yoga challenge. that’s right. Yoga. Every. Damn. Day.</p>
<p>My intentions for doing this: <br>
<b>To get back in damn good shape.</b> <br>
While traveling and living abroad the last four months, rice and carbs quickly became my best friends. Let&#39;s just say I didn&#39;t lose pounds from eating that.</p>
<p><b>To get out of the house and force myself to see people (seriously).</b> <br>
Because I was FUN-employed and erred on the side of a recluse, I anticipated spending most of my days at home by myself, doing job search-related activities on the computer, reading, journaling, or making something. </p>
<p><b>To love and honor myself.</b> <br>
In order to be able to give and receive the love we desire, we have to start with showing love for ourselves. There are many ways to do this, and yoga is one.</p>
<p><b>To keep improving on me.</b> <br>
Staying true to my personal motto, in permanent BETA.</p>
<p><span style="text-align: center;"> --- </span></p>
<p>I almost talked myself out of signing up at the nearby studio. </p>
<p>With no job yet, not the best track record of managing my money wisely (but I’m working hard on it), living off my savings in a very VERY expensive city, and friends and family giving their two cents left and right on how I should manage my savings, I thought hard on the opportunity cost of spending $40 to sign up at a yoga studio... Probably poorer spending decisions, so I did it anyways.</p>
<p>and I’m damn glad I did.</p>
<p>No one knows what’s best for you other than you. Listen to your intuition. It’s usually right about what you need for yourself.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.skillshare.com/classes/entrepreneurship/Design-Your-Habits-A-Hands-On-Introduction-to-Behavior-Design/978368389?via=profile">Designing this new daily habit</a> was a lot easier than I anticipated because of constant practice. Out of my many failures and successes in trying to form many new habits this past year, I began to see what worked and didn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>What works: <br>
<b>1) Make it so easy that it’s easier to do than not do.</b> <br>
I chose a studio within five minutes walking distance from home, so I wouldn&#39;t lose time before or after yoga that might cause a pain point and lessen the likelihood of me going.</p>
<p>I also chose a studio specifically because it had a mobile app, making it SO easy to sign up and cancel classes. And this studio’s app was simple and pleasant to use. Props for thoughtfully designing for your users!</p>
<p><b>2) Set up your trigger.</b> <br>
Right after every class, I signed up for the next class and put it in my calendar app. The simple act of scheduling something gave me a thrill inside (weird, I know), like the feeling you get of looking forward to something.</p>
<p><b>4) Reward yourself once.</b> <br>
I took a free calendar from the mail and pinned it on top of my desk with 30-day yoga challenge in <b>BOLD</b>. For everyday I practiced yoga, whether at the studio or at home, I put a big X on that day. This way I have a visual board of accumulated accomplishments.</p>

<p><b>5) Reward yourself another time.</b> <br>
My guilty pleasure--Foursquare. Owning and embracing my guilty pleasure, I would check in every time I went to yoga, so that whenever I look through my history of check-ins, I reward myself with the joy of seeing that I made it to the mat even if I didn’t do anything “socially” fun that day.</p>
<p><span style="text-align: center;"> --- </span></p>
<p>For the first five days, I  was on a roll. Yoga every damn day, hell yeah. </p>
<p>On the sixth day, I was caught in a conflict: to go to yoga or be there for someone going through a difficult situation. At first I felt both guilty and disappointed. Disappointed like f**ck, five days in and I’m already giving up on my challenge. Guilty for the selfish part of me wanting to go to yoga.</p>
<p>After taking a breath and giving space, I knew what I wanted to do: I hopped on the train to be there for that person.</p>
<p><span style="text-align: center;"> --- </span></p>
<p>Why I failed...or so I thought.</p>
<p><b>Why I failed:</b> <br> 
In the literal sense, I didn’t complete the challenge of practicing yoga for 30 consecutive days.</p>
<p><b>Why I didn’t fail: Two things </b> <br>
<b>I achieved all my original intentions for doing this 30-day challenge.</b> <br>
I realize that the 30-day challenge served its purpose to place a constraint, so that it would push me beyond my comfort zone to achieve the intentions I set for myself. Snowball effect: Feeling good and healthy from practicing yoga so frequently made me want to eat a mostly-vegetarian, home-cooked diet, wake up early, and get a full 7-8 hrs of sleep regularly. Good habits beget other good habits !</p>
<p><b>When faced with a decision between priorities, being there for someone during hard times was more important to me than keeping a yoga streak.</b> <br>
This conflict taught me to be able to distinguish between what’s “important” and truly important to me, be flexible and go with the flow.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>“80% of success is showing up.” - Woody Allen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After I broke my streak, there were a handful of other days I didn’t practice yoga this month. but more handfuls of days that I did practice.</p>
<p>20 out of 30 days is better than 1 or none at all. <br>
not a bad start.</p>
